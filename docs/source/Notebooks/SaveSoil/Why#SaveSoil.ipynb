    "Around the world, because we are not paying the right kind of attention to it, soil is losing its\n",

    "\n",
    "## What is the significance of organic matter in soil?\n",
    "- Soil is healthy and cultivable only when organic content is present in it. It degrades and\n",
    "becomes less fertile if there is not sufficient organic matter in the soil.\n",
    "\n",
    "- An increase of just 1% of the carbon stocks in the top meter of soils would be higher than the amount corresponding to the annual anthropogenic CO2 emissions from fossil fuel burning. \n",
